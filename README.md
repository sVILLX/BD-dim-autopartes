# ðŸ§  Dimensional Database  
### ðŸ“Š Based on a Real Transactional Database  

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project showcases the design and implementation of a **Dimensional Data Warehouse** built from a **real-world transactional database**.  
It demonstrates the **ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load)** and the creation of **star and snowflake schemas** optimized for analytical queries.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Transform transactional data into **an analytical model** for business intelligence.
- Apply **data modeling techniques** (fact and dimension tables).
- Use **SQL and visualization tools** for end-to-end analytics.
- Enable **fast, insightful reporting** using OLAP principles.
